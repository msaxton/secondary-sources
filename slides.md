## What is a Secondary source?

A _secondary source_ is a scholarly discussion based on primary sources. Typically, a secondary source contains original research.

### Examples of Secondary Sources
* Books
* Journal articles
* Scientific reports
* Lectures
* Podcasts


## Tips for Finding Secondary Sources

### Use Reference tools to build your bibliography and find key words for searching.

* [Oxford bibliographies](https://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?location=obo)
* [CREDO Reference](https://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?location=xreferplus)

#### Combine keywords and subject terms for efficient searching

* _Keywords_ are generated by the researcher (that's you!).
* Use the who, what, where, when, why, and/or how from your topic as keywords.

* Keywords ("Any field") searches:
    * title
    * author
    * table of contents / summary (if available)
    * subjects

* _Subject terms_ are generated by librarians to describe the main content a book or article.

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.


### Search beyond Tisch Library.

* [Libraries worldwide](https://tufts.on.worldcat.org/discovery)


### Find the right database, not just the one you are familiar with.


### Use Google, but use it wisely

* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### Document your research and manage your citations

* Maintain a research log to track database searches, keep an annotated bibliography, and take reading notes.
* [Sample research log](https://msaxton.notion.site/Sample-Research-Log-5d5743036c394ad184bab74eebf78acd)

* Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or similar software to manage your citations.
