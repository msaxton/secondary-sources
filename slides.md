## Finding Secondary Sources

### JumboSearch and Libraries Worldwide

For the best results, combine subject terms with keyword searching.

### Databases

* Are you looking for a subject specific database?
* What kind of source are you looking for? Journal article? Book? Essay?
* Do you need to find full-text items or will bibliographic information do?

### Useful Databases

### Use Google, but use it wisely

* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.
